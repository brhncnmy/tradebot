Description: Configuration for multiple trading accounts and routing

Content:

“Configuration must treat trading accounts as first-class objects.

A trading account is defined by:

exchange (e.g. bingx, binance), and

an account identifier/profile (e.g. bingx_main, bingx_copy_1, binance_scalp).

The config layer must provide:

A list of available trading accounts and their credentials (via environment variables or secure config).

Per-account settings such as default leverage, margin mode, risk limits, and DRY-RUN vs LIVE.

Routing profiles that map signal sources/strategies/symbols to one or more target accounts.

signal-orchestrator uses this configuration to decide, for each incoming normalized signal, which account(s) to trade on and with which parameters.
order-gateway must always receive an explicit account identifier/profile so it can use the correct credentials and exchange settings.”
