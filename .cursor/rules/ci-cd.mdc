Description: Tests, Docker, and Git steps must be included in implementation responses

Content:

“For implementation tasks in the TradeBot repository:

After describing the code and test changes, the final part of the answer (inside the Cursor Prompt Block) must include:

How to run the tests from the repo root.

How to build the updated Docker images with their tags.

How to push those images to the Docker registry.

How to stage, commit, and push the changes to the Git repository (with an example commit message and the expected branch).

Do not leave these steps implicit or as ‘then deploy it’.

Prefer explicit, repeatable commands that can be executed from the repo root and integrated into future CI/CD pipelines.”
