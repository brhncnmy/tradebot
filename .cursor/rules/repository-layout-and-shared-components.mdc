Description: Repo layout and shared code conventions

Content:

“The repository uses a monorepo layout:

services/<service-name>/src for service code.

services/<service-name>/tests for tests.

common/models for shared data models such as NormalizedSignal.

common/utils for shared utilities such as logging, HTTP client, and config helpers.

docker/ for per-service Dockerfiles.

docker-compose.yml in the repo root.

docs/ for architecture, API contracts, and runbooks.

When adding new code, prefer placing shared logic in common instead of duplicating it across services.
Keep each service small and focused on a single responsibility.”
