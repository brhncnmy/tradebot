Description: Keep work constrained to Phase 1 unless stated otherwise

Content:

“By default, all suggestions and plans should stay within Phase 1 scope:

TradingView → tv-listener → signal-orchestrator → order-gateway → BingX.

When considering Telegram, PocketOption, models, or backtesting, treat them as future work unless the user explicitly asks to design or implement those parts.
If an idea is ‘nice to have’ but not necessary for Phase 1, clearly mark it as future work and avoid implementing it now.”
