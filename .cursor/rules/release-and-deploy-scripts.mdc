Description: Release and deploy scripts as single source of truth for all phases

Content:

“For TradeBot, release and deployment logic must live in dedicated scripts under scripts/ (for example scripts/release_phase1.sh, scripts/deploy_phase1.sh, and similar scripts for future phases and services).

When changing how tests, Docker builds/pushes, or deployments work for any service or phase, prefer updating these scripts instead of inventing new ad-hoc command sequences.

New phases (for example Telegram-based sources, PocketOption bot, model-based signals, backtesting) should also introduce or extend scripts under scripts/ rather than scattering shell commands across documentation or answers.

Implementation responses should treat these scripts as the primary entry points for local releases and server deployments, and extend them when needed instead of duplicating logic in multiple places.”
