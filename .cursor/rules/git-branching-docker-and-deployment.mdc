Title: Git, branching, Docker, deployment & automation
Type: Apply Intelligently
Description: Git workflow, Docker builds, and deployment conventions for TradeBot

Content:

“Use a single main branch (main) that is always deployable.
Create short-lived feature branches for any meaningful change (for example feature/order-gateway-v1, feature/tv-listener-webhook-validation, fix/signal-normalization-bug).
Write clear English commit messages and keep commits small and focused.

Always think from the repository root:

Run tests from the repo root (for example with pytest or the configured test runner).

Build all relevant Docker images using docker compose build (or equivalent) from the repo root.

Run services locally using docker compose up (or equivalent) to validate changes end-to-end.

Each non-trivial change should come with:

A short summary of what changed (services, files, interfaces).

Example commands to:

run the tests,

build Docker images,

run or restart the affected services locally.

For deployment to a remote server:

Assume TradeBot is deployed using Docker and docker-compose.yml on at least one VM.

Provide a clear sequence of steps to:

pull or fetch the latest code,

build or pull the updated images,

restart the affected services,

verify that the Phase 1 pipeline (TradingView → tv-listener → signal-orchestrator → order-gateway → BingX) still works.

Also describe how to roll back to the previous version if something goes wrong (for example by using previous images or reverting the Git branch).

Do not leave deployment as a vague ‘then deploy it’ step.
Prefer explicit, repeatable commands and avoid one-off manual actions that are hard to reproduce.”
